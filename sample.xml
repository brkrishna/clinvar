        <Attribute Type="Description">In a 12-year-old patient with cholesteryl ester storage disease (278000) from a nonconsanguineous Polish-German family, Klima et al. (1993) detected a 72-bp in-frame deletion resulting in the loss of amino acid codons 254 through 277. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed that the 72 bp represented an exon, indicating that the deletion in the mRNA was caused by defective splicing. Sequence analysis of the patient's genomic DNA revealed a G-to-A substitution in the last nucleotide of the 72-bp exon on 1 allele. No normal-sized mRNA was detectable in the propositus even though he was not homozygous for the splice site mutation. Klima et al. (1993) concluded that the patient was compound heterozygous for the splice site mutation and a null allele. The patient showed LIPA activity in cultured skin fibroblasts approximately 9% of normal. Hepatosplenomegaly had been present since age 5 years.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">Aslanidis et al. (1996) restudied the patient of Klima et al. (1993) and defined the splice site mutation as a G-to-A mutation at position -1 of the splice donor site following exon 8, resulting in incorrect splicing and the removal of the 72-bp exon 8 of the LIPA gene. They determined that the other allele of the patient carried a premature termination mutation (613497.0003) as well as the L179P mutation (613497.0001); the LIPA mRNA was rendered unstable by the premature stop codon. Aslanidis et al. (1996) demonstrated that the splice site mutation allowed the production of approximately 3 to 4% of correctly spliced mRNA relative to wildtype. Aslanidis et al. (1996) also identified a mutation at the same splice donor site, and also resulting in deletion of exon 8, in 2 sibs with Wolman disease; that mutation, at the +1 position, allowed no correct splicing, and patient fibroblasts were devoid of enzymatic activity.

          <Attribute Type="public definition">The phenotypic spectrum of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency ranges from the infantile-onset form (Wolman disease) to later-onset forms collectively known as cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD). Wolman disease is characterized by infantile-onset malabsorption that results in malnutrition, storage of cholesterol esters and triglycerides in hepatic macrophages that results in hepatomegaly and liver disease, and adrenal gland calcification that results in adrenal cortical insufficiency. Unless successfully treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), infants with classic Wolman disease do not survive beyond age one year. CESD may present in childhood in a manner similar to Wolman disease or later in life with such findings as serum lipid abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and/or elevated liver enzymes long before a diagnosis is made. The morbidity of late-onset CESD results from atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease, stroke), liver disease (e.g., altered liver function Â± jaundice, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and related complications of esophageal varices, and/or liver failure), complications of secondary hypersplenism (i.e., anemia and/or thrombocytopenia), and/or malabsorption. Individuals with CESD may have a normal life span depending on the severity of disease manifestations.</Attribute>

          <Attribute Type="public definition">Acute intermittent porphyria (referred to as AIP in this GeneReview) results from half-normal activity of the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS). It is characterized clinically by life-threatening acute neurovisceral attacks of severe abdominal pain without peritoneal signs, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and hypertension. Attacks may be complicated by neurologic findings (mental changes, convulsions, and peripheral neuropathy that may progress to respiratory paralysis), and hyponatremia. Acute attacks, which may be provoked by certain drugs, alcoholic beverages, endocrine factors, calorie restriction, stress, and infections, usually resolve within two weeks. Most individuals with AIP have one or a few attacks; about 5% (mainly women) have recurrent attacks (defined as &gt;4 attacks/year) that may persist for years. Other long-term complications are chronic renal failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hypertension. Attacks, which are very rare before puberty, are more common in women than men. All individuals with a genetic change in the gene HMBS that predisposes to AIP are at risk of developing acute attacks; however, most never have symptoms and are said to have latent (or presymptomatic) AIP.</Attribute>

          <Attribute Type="public definition">Acute intermittent porphyria (referred to as AIP in this GeneReview) results from half-normal activity of the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS). It is characterized clinically by life-threatening acute neurovisceral attacks of severe abdominal pain without peritoneal signs, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and hypertension. Attacks may be complicated by neurologic findings (mental changes, convulsions, and peripheral neuropathy that may progress to respiratory paralysis), and hyponatremia. Acute attacks, which may be provoked by certain drugs, alcoholic beverages, endocrine factors, calorie restriction, stress, and infections, usually resolve within two weeks. Most individuals with AIP have one or a few attacks; about 5% (mainly women) have recurrent attacks (defined as &gt;4 attacks/year) that may persist for years. Other long-term complications are chronic renal failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and hypertension. Attacks, which are very rare before puberty, are more common in women than men. All individuals with a genetic change in the gene HMBS that predisposes to AIP are at risk of developing acute attacks; however, most never have symptoms and are said to have latent (or presymptomatic) AIP.</Attribute>

However, a 3.1% frequency was found among those 358 patients with a positive family history, giving P = 0.021 compared with population controls. Furthermore, patients with bilateral breast cancer were 6-fold more likely to be 1100delC carriers than were patients with unilateral cancer (P = 0.007). Analysis of the 1100delC variant in an independent set of 507 patients with familial breast cancer with no BRCA1 (113705) or BRCA2 (600185) mutations confirmed a significantly elevated frequency of the 1-bp deletion. Tissue microarray analysis indicated that breast tumors from patients with 1100delC mutations showed reduced CHEK2 immunostaining. The results indicated that CHEK2 acts as a low-penetrance tumor-suppressor gene in breast cancer and that it makes a significant contribution to familial clustering of breast cancer, including families with only 2 affected relatives, which are more common than families that include larger numbers of affected women.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">To evaluate the breast cancer risk associated with the 1100delC variant, the CHEK2 Breast Cancer Case-Control Consortium (2004) genotyped 10,860 breast cancer cases and 9,065 controls from 10 case-control studies in 5 countries. The 1100delC variant was found in 201 cases (1.9%) and in 64 controls (0.7%), giving an estimated odds ratio of 2.34. There was some evidence of a higher prevalence of the 1100delC variant among cases with a first-degree relative affected with breast cancer (odds ratio 1.44) and of a trend for a higher breast cancer odds ratio at younger ages at diagnosis. These results confirmed that the 1100delC variant confers an increased risk of breast cancer and that this risk is apparent in women unselected for family history. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that the 1100delC variant multiples the risks associated with susceptibility alleles in other genes to increase the risk of breast cancer.</Attribute>

Relatives of those who were carriers of CHEK2*1100delC had an even higher risk of breast cancer and prostate cancer. The results were interpreted as indicating a multiplicative interaction between CHEK2*1100delC and other unknown susceptibility genes.

        <Attribute Type="Description">In a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome-2 (609265), Bell et al. (1999) identified deletion of a cytosine at nucleotide 1100 of the CHK2 gene, resulting in premature termination in the kinase domain of the CHK2 protein. This heterozygous germline mutation was present in all 3 affected family members but was absent from unaffected family members and from 100 control alleles. Affected individuals had classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome with death from breast cancer, glioma, histiocytoma, and sarcoma. Family members had wildtype p53 (191170).</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">In Finland, Vahteristo et al. (2002) found that the frequency of 1100delC was 2.0% among an unselected population-based cohort of 1,035 patients with breast cancer, as compared with the 1.4% frequency found among 1,885 population control subjects (P = 0.182). However, a 3.1% frequency was found among those 358 patients with a positive family history, giving P = 0.021 compared with population controls. Furthermore, patients with bilateral breast cancer were 6-fold more likely to be 1100delC carriers than were patients with unilateral cancer (P = 0.007). Analysis of the 1100delC variant in an independent set of 507 patients with familial breast cancer with no BRCA1 (113705) or BRCA2 (600185) mutations confirmed a significantly elevated frequency of the 1-bp deletion. Tissue microarray analysis indicated that breast tumors from patients with 1100delC mutations showed reduced CHEK2 immunostaining. The results indicated that CHEK2 acts as a low-penetrance tumor-suppressor gene in breast cancer and that it makes a significant contribution to familial clustering of breast cancer, including families with only 2 affected relatives, which are more common than families that include larger numbers of affected women.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">Meijers-Heijboer et al. (2003) defined a subset of families with hereditary breast cancer characterized by the presence of colorectal cancer cases (HBCC). The 1100delC variant was present in 18% of 55 families with HBCC, as compared with 4% of 380 families with breast cancer and without colorectal cancer. The 1100delC mutation was not, however, the major predisposing factor for the HBCC phenotype, but appeared to act in synergy with at least 1 unknown susceptibility gene.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">To evaluate the breast cancer risk associated with the 1100delC variant, the CHEK2 Breast Cancer Case-Control Consortium (2004) genotyped 10,860 breast cancer cases and 9,065 controls from 10 case-control studies in 5 countries. The 1100delC variant was found in 201 cases (1.9%) and in 64 controls (0.7%), giving an estimated odds ratio of 2.34. There was some evidence of a higher prevalence of the 1100delC variant among cases with a first-degree relative affected with breast cancer (odds ratio 1.44) and of a trend for a higher breast cancer odds ratio at younger ages at diagnosis. These results confirmed that the 1100delC variant confers an increased risk of breast cancer and that this risk is apparent in women unselected for family history. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that the 1100delC variant multiples the risks associated with susceptibility alleles in other genes to increase the risk of breast cancer.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">Comparing data for 34 breast cancer patients with a germline 1100delC mutation with those for 102 breast cancer patients without this mutation, de Bock et al. (2004) concluded that carrying the 1100delC mutation is an adverse prognostic indicator. Mutation carriers more frequently had a female first- or second-degree relative with breast cancer and had a more unfavorable prognosis regarding the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer and distant metastasis-free survival.</Attribute>

        <Attribute Type="Description">Johnson et al. (2005) found that relatives of bilateral breast cancer cases who were wildtype for CHEK2 had 3 times the population risk of female breast cancer, twice the risk of prostate cancer, and a large excess of male breast cancer. Relatives of those who were carriers of CHEK2*1100delC had an even higher risk of breast cancer and prostate cancer. The results were interpreted as indicating a multiplicative interaction between CHEK2*1100delC and other unknown susceptibility genes. They suggested that bilateral breast cancer cases and their families are likely to provide an efficient basis for identification of additional low-penetrance breast cancer genes.</Attribute>
